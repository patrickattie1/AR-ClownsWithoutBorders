# AR-Clowns Without Borders Photo Exhibition, April 2018

This AR application was designed using Unity and Vuforia.

The app was pre-installed on Android tablets and was used by the visitors of the photo exhibition to "augment" the image targets that were hanged on the walls.

The 15 photos printed for the exhibition (image targets for AR augmentation) can be found in the Assets\Datafiles\ImageTargets directory(size ~ 6 Mb).
